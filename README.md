# Final Project Part 2

This assignment challenged us to create a completely responsive website from scratch, unlike the last assignment where we had to convert code for an already established site. It was a great way for us to get more practice with what we have already learned.

## Resources

* [HTML5 Boiler Plate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) was used to help style out some of the HTML structure elements with the "visuallyhidden" class to keep the design clean.

* [CSS3 Generator](http://css3generator.com/) was used to assist with styling of elements.

* [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) was used to help refresh on certain css properties and rules.

* Other than what is listed above, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Comments

I found myself struggling most with this assignment, but I really liked that challenge. It's definitely a different monster when you compare the last assignment to this one. At first, I started thinking that converting already written code was a lot easier than doing this from scratch, but after the second day of working with my own code, it changed my mind. Now I have a way better understanding of how media queries work and am excited to use them in all my future projects.
